# 🎲 Dice Roll Simulation

## 📌 Project Overview
This project simulates rolling a fair six-sided dice multiple times using Python.
The goal is to understand **probability, randomness, noise, and basic statistics**
through a simple and intuitive experiment.

This project is part of my **Data Science learning journey**, focused on building
strong conceptual foundations.
